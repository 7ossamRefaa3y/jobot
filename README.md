     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Your [Supabase Anon API key](https://app.supabase.com/project/rbvvbmvfzbgqpqghtvgg/settings/api?)
     - `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Your OpenAI API key

5. (Optional) [Connect a custom domain](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/domains/add-a-domain) (e.g. https://jobot.dev ) to your Vercel project.

## Development

After you've deployed your own copy of Jobot, follow these additional steps to develop Jobot:

1. Clone your repository to your computer or open it online [using GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/creating-a-codespace-for-a-repository#creating-a-codespace-for-a-repository)

   - If you're developing locally, make sure to install the latest versions of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

2. Open the repository on VS Code, launch the terminal, and run these commands:

   ```
   cd jobot-web     # enter NextJS project
   npm install      # install dependencies
   npm run dev      # run development server
   ```

   You should now be able to open up the application in a new browser tab and interact with it.

3. Create a file `.env.local` inside the `jobot-web` folder and add proper values for the following enviroment variables:

   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=xxx
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=xxx
   OPENAI_API_KEY=xxx
   ```

4. Make any desired code changes and the development server should refresh the application automatically

5. [Stage, commit, and push](https://zeroesandones.medium.com/how-to-commit-and-push-your-changes-to-your-github-repository-in-vscode-77a7a3d7dd02) your changes back to the GitHub repository when ready

6. If you've set up a Vercel project, any changes made to the `main` branch of your repository will get pushed automatically

**NOTE**: If you'd like to contribute your changes back to the original repository https://github.com/jovianhq/jobot, please [create a pull request from your fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork). We welcome community contributions to Jobot!
